## Acceptance Criteria

```
GIVEN I am taking a code quiz
WHEN I click the start button
THEN a timer starts and I am presented with a question
WHEN I answer a question
THEN I am presented with another question
WHEN I answer a question incorrectly
THEN time is subtracted from the clock
WHEN all questions are answered or the timer reaches 0
THEN the game is over
WHEN the game is over
THEN I can save my initials and my score
```

## Features

This quiz built on vanilla JavaScript features a number of functions that enabled us to practice a number of logical operators, functions and array methods that JS offers.  Some of the features include:
- setTimer()
- use of booleans to determine true or false answers
- for() loops to dynamically render questions, answers, and buttons for each question stored in an array (API).
- UI to allow users to quit or try again
- local storage functions

##  Future Enhancements

This was a very challenging assignment for Week 4 of bootcamp, but I learned more from it than anything else we've done so far in the course.

In the future, I would like to add more questions to the quiz, store scores in local storage during the session so users can retrive all of their scores, and render the "High Score" page on a different page altogether through Reactjs.
