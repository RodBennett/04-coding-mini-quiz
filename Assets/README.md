04 Coding Quiz challenge

Deployment link: https://rodbennett.github.io/04-coding-mini-quiz/

In this assignment, I created a short coding quiz using the new functions and methods from JavaScript that we've been using in class.  The quiz consists of 5 questions and it functions with the use of buttons to indicate answers.

To being with, the user is faced with a start page to being the quiz.

As soon as the start button is hit, the timer begins to count down from 70 seconds.

Afer the user answer each question, there is text on the bottom on the container that indicates if the answer is correct or not. Score is kept at the top right hand corner of the page, (5 points per correct answer / 0 points per wrong answer).  Also, if an answer is incorrect, then the clock is deduted by q0 seconds.

After all of the questions have been answered, the user is faced with a page that asks if they would like to check their final score, or play again.  If "Play again" is chosen, then the quiz goes back to the beginning of the quiz and the timer starts again.

If on the other hand, the user chooses to "Check score" they will come to another screen where they can see their score and input and save their initials.  Again, there is an option to play again or to quit the app.

This was a very challenging assignment, but I learned more from it than anything else we've done so far in the course.
